My resume, live at https://resume.jacobstephens.net.

This site was originally developed using Gatsby, but in November 2023, I wanted to shift to the simpler editing setup of vanilla HTML modifications without a build process, so I am now editing the HTML / CSS / JS output by Gatsby, but no longer running the Gatsby build process.
