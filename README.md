# jacobstephens-resume
My resume, live at https://resume.jacobstephens.net.

This site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was originally developed using Gatsby, but has been converted to a static HTML site for simpler editing and maintenance. The original Gatsby source code has been archived in the `gatsby-archive` folder.
